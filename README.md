Hi, Iâ€™m SLY-Kong,a student in TianjinUniversity of Technology.

I'm learning back end knowledge to improve myself.

I also want to learn some front-end and cryptography knowledge.

I will use github as a witness to my learning journey and try my best to learn programming,Of course, there may be mistakes.
